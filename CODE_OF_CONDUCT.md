# Laranode Code of Conduct

## 1. Our Pledge
In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming community, we (contributors, maintainers, and users) pledge to make participation in the **Laranode** project a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual orientation.

We are committed to building an environment where everyone feels respected, supported, and encouraged to contribute.

## 2. Our Standards
Examples of behaviour that contributes to a positive environment include:
- Using welcoming and inclusive language.
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences.
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism.
- Focusing on what’s best for the project and community.
- Showing empathy towards other community members.

Examples of unacceptable behaviour include:
- Harassment, discrimination, or personal attacks.
- Use of sexualised language or imagery, or unwelcome sexual attention.
- Trolling, insulting, or derogatory comments.
- Public or private harassment of any individual.
- Publishing others’ private information (such as physical or email address) without explicit permission.
- Any conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional environment.

## 3. Scope
This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces (such as GitHub issues, discussions, and pull requests) and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community.  
Examples include using an official project email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as a representative at an online or offline event.

## 4. Enforcement
Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behaviour and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behaviour that they deem unacceptable, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

### Enforcement Guidelines
Maintainers may take the following actions:
1. **Warning** – A private or public warning that the behaviour is inappropriate.
2. **Temporary Ban** – Temporarily suspending participation in discussions or contributions.
3. **Permanent Ban** – Permanent removal from all project spaces if the behaviour is severe or repeated.

The maintainers reserve the right to remove, edit, or reject any contributions (issues, commits, comments, code, etc.) that do not align with this Code of Conduct.

## 5. Reporting
If you experience or witness unacceptable behaviour, please report it by contacting the Laranode maintainers
- use GitHub’s private issue feature or message a maintainer directly.

Please include as much detail as possible:
- Description of the incident.  
- Where it occurred (issue, PR, discussion, etc).  
- Who was involved (if known).  
- Any relevant links or screenshots.

All reports will be handled confidentially and reviewed promptly.

## 6. Attribution
This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct/) version 2.1.
